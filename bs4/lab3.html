            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
              <p>  JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                  <ul><li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li></ul>
              </p><p>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.</p>

            <h3>What you should already know</h3>
            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:

                A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
                Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
                Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</p>

          <div id="Helloworld" class="tabcontent">
            <h3>Hello World</h3>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Web Console in multi-line mode, and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:<br>

              <div> <p>  (function(){<br>
                  "use strict";<br>
                  /* Start of your code */<br>
                  function greetMe(yourName) {<br>
                    alert('Hello ' + yourName);<br>
                  }<br>
                
                  greetMe('World');<br>
                  /* End of your code */<br>
                })();</p>

            </div>
               <p> Press Cmd+Enter or Ctrl+Enter (or click the Run button) to watch it unfold in your browser!<br>
                </p><p>In the following pages, this guide introduces you to the JavaScript syntax and language features, so that you will be able to write more complex applications.
                
                </p>But for now, remember to always include the (function(){"use strict"; before your code, and add })(); to the end of your code.
                </p>
          </div>
          <div id="Variables" class="tabcontent">
            <h3>Variables</h3>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p> A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0–9).
                
                Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) as well as "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
            <p>
                
                You can use most of ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. (For more details, see this blog post.) You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers.
                
               </p>
               <p> Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, $credit, and _name.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="DeclaringVariables" class="tabcontent">
            <h3>Declaring Variables</h3>
            <p>You can declare a variable in two ways:<ul><li>

                With the keyword var. For example, var x = 42. This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables, depending on the execution context.
               </li> <li>With the keyword const or let. For example, let y = 13. This syntax can be used to declare a block-scope local variable. (See Variable scope below.)</li></ul>
               <p> You can declare variables to unpack values from Object Literals using the Destructuring Assignment syntax. For example, let { bar } = foo. This will create a variable named bar and assign to it the value corresponding to the key of the same name from our object foo.</p>
                
                <p>You can also assign a value to a variable For example, x = 42. This form creates an undeclared global variable. It also generates a strict JavaScript warning. Undeclared global variables can often lead to unexpected behavior. Thus, it is discouraged to use undeclared global variables.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="Variablescope" class="tabcontent">
            <h3>Variablescope</h3>
            <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
            <p>

                JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope. Rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within.
